## Getting Started
Getting started is supes simps:

#### First you need to link the stylesheet
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style/sheet.css">
```

#### Structuring your layouts
```html
<div class="wrap">
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
    <div class="block-3">Content here</div>
</div>
```
Creating a three-column layout is supes simps (this will scale each column down to 100% width on mobile). Wrap the .block's in a .wrap class to clear the left floats.

#### Customizing your grid
Maybe you want to kick-it old school and create a two-column layout â€” it's mad simps. All you need to know is basic math (as long as the .block- classes equal 100%, it will be fire).
```html
<div class="wrap">
    <div class="block-75">Some rad content here</div>
    <div class="block-25">Some informational content here</div>
</div>
```
Creating the css is also simps:
```css
.block-75 { width: 75%; }
.block-25 { width: 25%; }
```
